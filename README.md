### Community Agencies Revival Project : for Kerbal Space Program

The Community Agencies Revival Project is a modding toolkit / framework that provides a new agency-based gameplay mechanic for other mods to use. Anyone can install CARP to see how it works, but it only affects the game when other mods use its features:

* a new rep value for each agency indicating what they think of the player's space program
* agency rep affected by game events (e.g. contract completion) plus inter-agency "standing" values
* data persisted in save file and displayed via UI popup
* customisable strategy effects to modify agency rep
* events and methods that plugin authors can use
* support for custom agencies added by mods
* fixes for missing agency-related data (manufacturers, agents & logos) in the stock game + a few part mods
